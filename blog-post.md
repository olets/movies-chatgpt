As an experienced web developer, I was excited to work with Assistant, an artificial intelligence trained by OpenAI, to create an app that displays data from The Movie Database.

At first, I was unsure of how well Assistant would be able to handle the task. But I was pleasantly surprised by how well Assistant was able to assist me in creating the app.

Together, we were able to create an app that has pages for Popular movies, Top Rated movies, a page for each genre, a page for each movie, and a page for each actor. The Popular page lists the most popular movies on The Movie Database, as a grid of movie cards. The Top Rated page lists the movies on The Movie Database which have a ten out of ten rating, as a grid of movie cards. Genre pages have a dynamic route, ending in the genre name; genre pages list the movies in that genre, as a grid of movie cards.

When users click on a movie card, they are taken to that movie's page. The movie page shows the movie's image, it's title, a list of actors (avatar and name), and related movies. On the movie page, clicking on an actor takes the user to that actor's page. The actor page shows the actor's name, image, and related movies.

Despite its impressive abilities, however, it's important to remember that Assistant is still just an artificial intelligence. It doesn't have the same level of creativity, critical thinking, or problem-solving skills as a human. As such, it wouldn't have been able to create the app on its own. In fact, it couldn't have even come close.

I was able to provide the framework for the app, and guide Assistant in the right direction. I recognized mistakes and was able to fix them. I knew what to ask for, and was able to provide clear and concise instructions for Assistant to follow. Without my expertise and guidance, the app simply wouldn't have worked.

This raises interesting questions about the future of work, and the role of AI in it. As AI continues to advance and become more capable, will it eventually be able to replace human workers in a variety of fields? Or will there always be a need for human expertise and guidance?

"Artificial intelligence is advancing at an unprecedented rate, but it will never replace the human mind," said futurist Ray Kurzweil. "Our unique abilities to be creative, to be empathetic, and to be intuitive will always set us apart from machines."

Meanwhile, Nan Shepherd wrote, "The mind of man is capable of anything because everything is in it, all the past as well as all the future."

It's clear that, for now at least, AI still has a long way to go.
