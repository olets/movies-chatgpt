As an experienced web dev, I recently partnered with Assistant, an AI trained by OpenAI, to create a new app that displays data from The Movie Database. I was pleasantly surprised by how well Assistant was able to assist me in creating the app, and it got me thinking about the role of AI in the world of software engineering.

Together, we created an app with pages for Popular movies, Top Rated movies, each movie genre, each movie, and each actor. When users click on a movie card, they're taken to that movie's page, which includes a list of actors and related movies. Clicking on an actor's name takes the user to the actor's page, which includes a list of the movies they've appeared in.

Of course, it's important to remember that Assistant is still just an AI. It doesn't have the same level of creativity, critical thinking, or problem-solving skills as a human. Without my expertise and guidance, the app simply wouldn't have worked. This raises interesting questions about the future of work and the role of AI in it.

As AI continues to advance, will it eventually be able to replace human workers in a variety of fields? Or will there always be a need for human expertise and guidance?

"AI is advancing at an unprecedented rate, but it will never replace the human mind," said futurist Ray Kurzweil. "Our unique abilities to be creative, empathetic, and intuitive will always set us apart from machines."

It's clear that, for now at least, AI still has a long way to go. But I'm excited to see what the future holds for this technology, and how it will continue to evolve and shape the world of software engineering.
